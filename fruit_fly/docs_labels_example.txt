<doc id=0 url=https://boingboing.net/2021/09/20/ai-draws-movie-posters-based-on-textual-descriptions-of-films.html class=ai>
Noah Veltman took textual descriptions of several famous movies, then fed them to an AI — to have it generate a graphical version of what the text describes. The result: AI movie posters. That one above? Ocean's Eleven. They're pretty trippy to look at! Veltman cleverly made his experiment into a game: On his page, he shows you several dozen of the images and you can try to guess which movie the AI is drawing, before clicking on the caption to reveal the correct name. I managed to guess a few — including Star Wars and The Wizard of Oz. But a lot of them were pretty cryptic: I had no idea I was looking at Ferris Bueller's Day Off. If you want a deeper explanation of the type of AI Veltman used — dubbed "VQGAN+CLIP" — you can read about it here. (tl;dr: it's a type of GAN that mixes convolutional neural networks with transformers — the latter more typically used in language — and smooshes it together with a model that matches captions to images.)

Project Farm performed an unusually rigorous set of tests on different brands of spray paint, then left out the painted panels in the elements for a year. He even sprayed the hood of his truck to see how a DIY paint job with each would stand up. The standard premium options from Rustoleum and Valspar turn out to be predictable winners, but it's always good to be reminded that the dollar cans from WalMart are terrible—and so is the really expensive stuff.

Real zombies? According to voodoo, the dead can be raised by a sorcerer and kept either in a trance or as a slave. Starting in the 1930s and continuing through most of the 20th century, some people believed that this was based on fact. Starting with accounts of Haitian folklore by Zora Neale Hurston in 1937 and made famous by Wade Davis' 1985 book The Serpent and the Rainbow, it was believed that zombies could be made by poisoning people with tetrodotoxin, the poisonous substance found in pufferfish (family Tetraodontidae). The poison would be administered and make the victim appear dead, and due to the climate in Haiti which would lead to a rotting corpse within days, if not hours, burial would be swift — often without checking if the body was actually dead. Following this, voodoo magicians would find and exhume the body, reviving it to zombie-like state, possibly with the help of datura, the so-called "zombie cucumber." The assertions by folklore researchers that real zombies have been roaming around in Haiti has been repeatedly criticised by science, not least by raising the numerous factual inaccuracies in The Serpent and the Rainbow.[1][2] The symptoms of tetrodotoxin poisoning are well known — and while they include nausea, paralysis and eventual death — "death-like trances" and "zombification" are not listed. Mainstream science theorises that the claims regarding real zombies are far-fetched and that the "case-reports" from Haiti can be explained by the deep cultural meaning of vodou in the country — that expectations of what the witch doctors can do are enough to induce trances in their victims, rather that any clinical effect due to tetrodotoxin or any other chemical that they may be brewing up to create zombie slaves. The most complex part of the powders, part of a recently deceased child's brain, was not investigated because none of the scientists felt like being remembered as a supervillain by their peers. More importantly drugs made out of dead people (particularly children) are notoriously hard to sell legally, apart from non-synthetic Human growth hormone taken from cadavers.

<doc id=3 url=https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Sunshine_Policy class=policy>
The Sunshine Policy (햇볕정책) is a type of South Korean policy toward North Korea: the official name is Engagement Policy (대북화해협력정책). The main aim is to establish peace on the Korean Peninsula by pursuing cooperation between South and North Korea on the basis of nationalism and pacifism. Mainstream liberals in South Korea support this policy. Supporters of the Sunshine Policy are skeptical of excessive sanctions and 'maximum pressure' on North Korea, and believe that dialogue, compromise, trust and economic aid can help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. This policy is mainly related to liberal nationalism and left-wing nationalism in South Korea. But conservatives in South Korea hate this policy very much. In 2000, Kim Dae-jung was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his successful implementation of the Sunshine Policy. The Sunshine Policy lasted from 1998 to 2007 when the liberal South Korean government was in office. However, this policy was suspended since 2008 when the conservative government took office. But with the inauguration of the liberal government in 2017, the Sunshine Policy is being pursued again. The policy originates from the OstpolitikWikipedia of Willy Brandt, a former West German chancellor. Non-mainstream U.S. politicians such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders support the policy in part, but not completely. Because even though they agree to talk and compromise during the Sunshine Policy, they don't agree to economic aid to North Korea. This is because they think that there should be talks with North Korea, but at the same time, there should be maximum pressure. (However, some of America's alt-right actively support this policy. Because it's a policy based on nationalism. Of course, it would not be possible for American alt-rights to like the mainstream liberals in South Korea. Support for feminism is because mainstream liberals in South Korea!) South Korea's conservative camp is more extreme on many issues than the U.S. Republican Party. Of course, there is no lack of non-mainstream liberals in the South who oppose the policy. But the problem is that they are the Bareunmirae Party, which has contacts with Western alt-lite. As such, South Korean politics is deformed, so many young people are disgusted with politics.

<doc id=4 url=https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/One-child_policy class=policy>
The one-child policy was an initiative to reduce overpopulation via economic pressures in the People's Republic of China. Adopted in 1979 under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping,[1] and partially funded by the United Nations Population Fund, the policy limits families to one two three children for the 36% of the population to which it applies. The policy has successfully reduced population growth, and improved economic and environmental conditions to some extent, since families and communities are expending less money and fewer resources on children. However, critics have claimed that these benefits could have occurred anyway as part of economic trends or under less oppressive policies. The latter argument seems to have won out, with Xi Jinping starting to loosen the policy in 2013. In October 2015, the CPC announced they would replace the policy with a two-child policy. Which was replaced with a three-child policy in 2021. Which was likely done to slow down China's rapidly aging population. The policy has its origins in the work of Song Jian, a top-level Chinese scientist, who was trained in cybernetics and military science. Song did not have experience in demography, but was instead influenced by the Club of Rome's views on population and the environment as published in The Limits to Growth.[7] Rather than seek out the advice of demographers, as there were none in China at the time, Song instead applied his expertise in cybernetics to population control.

Free software means that the software's users have freedom. (The issue is not about price.) We developed the GNU operating system so that users can have freedom in their computing. Specifically, free software means users have the four essential freedoms: (0) to run the program, (1) to study and change the program in source code form, (2) to redistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified versions. Software differs from material objects—such as chairs, sandwiches, and gasoline—in that it can be copied and changed much more easily. These facilities are why software is useful; we believe a program's users should be free to take advantage of them, not solely its developer.

<doc id=6 url=https://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/NASA class=nasa>
The National Awesome Space Agency (NASA) is an entity of the United States government that is responsible for all things relating to space. This includes space travel, spacewalking, space aliens, and Kevin Spacey. Its most well-known accomplishments include landing on the moon and inventing a pen that can write in space. NASA currently has plans to return to the moon after a 45 year hiatus; critics say that this is a 'bad idea' and 'the moon was terrible to NASA, why should NASA take the moon back?' Other plans include colonizing Mars in case of slight incidents on the Earth, combating rogue asteroids, and reaching into space as deep as Uranus. The motto of NASA is "for the benefit of all", referring to its goal of eventually putting every person, place, and object on the Earth into perfect circular orbit of the Earth. The administration is constantly under fire from angry taxpayers claiming that it is a waste of money; such detractors are known to vanish and reappear months later in the Nevada desert. For those without comedic tastes, the self-proclaimed experts at Wikipedia have an article about NASA. Early 20th century experimental moon landing vehicle. Originally formed in 1787 when America's founding fathers set aside a large portion of the nation's resources for a space program, NASA was put on hold for more nearly two hundred years. In the 1950s, the Evil Soviet Empire began work on their space program, eventually launching a number of inanimate objects into space. Endless taunts by USSR radar bases and furry hat factory workers caused the United States much shame due to their inability to retaliate in kind. When the Soviet "Muttnik" program successfully launched several stray dogs into space and returned them safely, America could stand losing no longer, and resurrected NASA in 1958.

<doc id=7 url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/887533/how-do-20-questions-ai-algorithms-work class=ai>
Simple online games of 20 questions powered by an eerily accurate AI. How do they guess so well? You can think of it as the Binary Search Algorithm. In each iteration, we ask a question, which should eliminate roughly half of the possible word choices. If there are total of N words, then we can expect to get an answer after log2(N) questions. With 20 question, we should optimally be able to find a word among 2^20 = 1 million words. One easy way to eliminate outliers (wrong answers) would be to probably use something like RANSAC. This would mean, instead of taking into account all questions which have been answered, you randomly pick a smaller subset, which is enough to give you a single answer. Now you repeat that a few times with different random subset of questions, till you see that most of the time, you are getting the same result. you then know you have the right answer. Of course this is just one way of many ways of solving this problem.

A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE. Crunch. Crunch. Cheerfully trampling the path of paint-speckled gravel, John Dupin smiled. He'd long since learned to relish the minor victories. Working in the Department of Budget Management was never easy, especially at a facility as complex as Site-19, but he had been on fire lately. Anomalies had been dropping dead at a steady, almost alarming rate for months, freeing up more and more funds once their containment was no longer necessary, and that was nearly enough to make a hero out of even an accountant. Sure, some people might look down on Dupin. He had been called many names in the past for disallowing project proposals. Whenever some fool scientist underestimated the scope of their containment needs with disastrous consequences, his ass was on the line for not over-budgeting. But none of that mattered, not really. He knew how important his work was; the Foundation didn't have infinite money, no matter how many people had gotten it into their heads that it did, and every cent not wasted was a cent he could put towards literally saving the world. Dupin daydreamed about the meeting which had resulted in the little triumph of cheap infrastructure he was presently treading into dust. He couldn't remember the dead skip's number, but that didn't matter. What mattered was that it had been made out of… "Concrete." "Mhmm." Director Tilda Moose didn't bother to look up from her computer. "There's a budget appropriation for new concrete, to pave the path to the Tau-1 helipad, but I don't think it's actually necessary. I… um. I was hoping you could sign this requisition form? I'm looking to re-use materials from a recent neutralization." Dupin slid a single sheet in front of her keyboard. "You mean tearing up the containment chamber? Why would I need to sign for that?" Still she didn't look up. "No, not the containment chamber. The concrete…" Moose's eyes finally left the computer and met Dupin's. "The concrete…?" "On… the thing, the actual skip was basically made of concrete, Director. We can save money by repurposing it." There was a moment of silence as her eyes widened. "How much money?" "I… …" She raised one eyebrow. "…well, it's not an exact figure but, if my calculations are right, about… twelve American dollars." Dupin smiled nervously. Moose's eyes widened further in the space before she blinked, once. "You want to repurpose a formerly-hostile, presumably living anomaly, to save twelve dollars?" He tried to make his nervous smile look eager instead. "Yes, Site Director. Pave and save!" She sighed, and pressed one hand to her forehead. "Alright, fine. Did you bring a pen?" He winced at the memory, wishing he'd forgotten a few of the details, squinting so hard that for a moment — just a moment — his eyes actually closed. Damn, but the sun is bright this time of… The gravel shifted beneath his feet, and his legs got tangled up, and as he opened his eyes again he saw the painted path rising up to meet him in a burst of black and red. Crunch.

<doc id=9 url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedBambooTechnology class=technology>
Riker: I've seen these things all over the ship. They all look the same: primitive, and... non-functional. Picard: Ceremonial; and deceptively primitive. — Star Trek: The Next Generation ("Masks") To quote the main article, Bamboo Technology covers "the use of mechanisms with a level of technology closer to the Stone Age to achieve feats usually achieved with Industrial or even Modern Age technology." Sufficiently Advanced Bamboo Technology, on the other hand, covers mechanisms with a Stone Age (or other ancient period, like Bronze Age, Iron Age, Medieval Period, etc...) appearance but a High Tech function that is beyond the achievements of Industrial or Modern Age technology: primitive-looking but highly advanced technology. Like the Stone Age equivalent of Crystal Spires and Togas, this is very often used to illustrate how advanced a culture's technology is by making it blend in almost seamlessly with their environment and/or architecture. Ancient Astronauts and Precursors have the interesting habit of building their technology to look like primitive artifacts. This is distinguished from classic Bamboo Technology in function but not in form. In this case, apparently primitive constructs are actually technologically advanced devices. A shield generator, ancient godlike computer, or powerful superweapon may resemble a monument, or idol, a small handheld artifact. Rock faces will hide glowing energy conduits. Crystals can do anything from teleporting of people and objects to enhancing latent psychic powers. Carved stone tablets contain hidden machinery, or Nanotechnology, or some other Applied Phlebotinum. Ancient control centers and consoles will resemble temples and altars. In many cases, the technology is designed to mimic the appearance of Magitek, but is actually Applied Phlebotinum. Usually the aliens in this first variation are Precursors, Ancient Astronauts, or both, and inhabit the higher end of the Kardashev Scale, but there are exceptions. Though being "Sufficiently Advanced" is usually a characteristic of the makers of such technology, it's not required: Higher-Tech Species are known to adopt this style as well. Civilizations at the Crystal Spires and Togas level are very likely to use this kind of technology, often subtly blending it in with their surroundings or by making it appear decorative. The Artifact of Doom or the MacGuffin in a Sci-Fi setting, if of alien or other fantastic origin, is usually an example of this technology. Many a Power Crystal and Mineral MacGuffin are examples as well. The more ancient Lost Technology is, the more likely it will be an example of this trope. Often, you will know when this sort of technology is working because Power Glows. Also note that many of the examples involve some form of psionic crystal, or are combined with psionic powers. Many an Advanced Ancient Acropolis are filled with such devices.

<doc id=10 url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnonymousPublicPhoneCall class=phone-call>
The older sister trope to Burner Phones. This is when a character, usually in an area with only a few services and no internet, uses a public phone, like a pay phone or phone booth, but the other character who is being called is unsure on who's calling, as the caller has made a disguised or anonymous call. Public phones have the caller labeled as anonymous at worst, and labeled as the pay phone at best. Because of how the caller is kept private or anonymous, the caller can disguise themselves or come off as someone else, or disguise the activity taking place. This complicates Phone-Trace Race, making it harder for others to track them down. Though, it is the only way to trace people who have gone missing on a road trip. Alternatively, this trope could be used to play a Prank Call on others. In Real Life, pay phone and phone booth calls keep the caller anonymous, but the pay phone can be tracked down by the Police and other services. Authorities are not stupid and the few remaining pay phones in modern countries are extremely likely to be under camera surveillance - combine this with the plethora of cameras in modern society they can very likely track you to and from your starting location and the pay phone making it very unlikely you'll actually be anonymous if you do this. This trope is largely a Discredited Trope now, due to Technology Marches On, as public phones are now fairly difficult to find (the UK still has a few thousand telephone boxes dotted around the isle, however). Compare Secret Identity Change Trick, when a plot device, such as Phone Booths and Pay Phones, is used as a method of hiding a disguise for transformation. May overlap with Prank Call or Harassing Phone Call. If you are looking for the use of any object as a disguise, the correct page is Mobile Shrubbery. It does not matter if the receiver knows the person, but doesn't know that the caller is the person. After all, Tropes Are Flexible.
